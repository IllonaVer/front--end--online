      Bicycle
     </h1>

      <p>
       <strong> A bicycle </strong>  is a <em> vehicle propelled </em> by the power of human muscles. Bicycles usually have two wheels; there are also tricycles.
       <p> 
        Today, there are more than a billion bicycles in use in the world; thus the bicycle is the most common means of transport. It became so due to low cost (including the cost of operation), small weight and size, lack of need for fuel and safety elements. In the developed countries of the modern world, bicycles are gaining popularity due to sports load and environmental cleanliness.</p>
      </p>
      <p> 
        <strong> Taiwan </strong> is one of the leading bicycle manufacturers in the world.
     </p>
     <p>
      In 2005, according to the results of a poll of public opinion in Great Britain, the bicycle was named the most significant technical invention since 1800. More respondents voted for it than for all other inventions combined.
     </p>
     <p>
      Between 1950 and 2007, bicycle production quadrupled, according to the Earth Policy Institute[en], an American environmental organization, while automobile production only doubled during the same period. Fuel prices and traffic congestion in cities are believed to be the reason for the increase, and this trend continues

      Structure and parts of a bicycle
     </h2>
      <p>
        A bicycle consists of <strong> a frame </strong> on which the wheels are attached, <strong>a handlebar with a fork that turns the front wheel, pedals on cranks, and a saddle, usually with a shock absorber.</strong>
      </p>
      <p> 
        Many bicycles are equipped with a trunk, a bell, reflectors (cataphotes) (in Ukraine and many other countries it is customary to put a white reflector in front, a red one in the back, yellow ones on the wheels, red ones on the pedals) or battery-powered flashlights (white in the front, red in the back) or minielectric generators. In many countries, a bell or flashlights are mandatory.

         The bike computer calculates the speed and distance traveled.

      <h3>
         <em> Frame</em>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong> <em> Frame </em></strong>Traditionally, bicycles are divided into <strong>men's and women's.</strong>
      </p>
      <p> 
        In terms of shape, a traditional frame has the appearance of two adjacent triangles, the smaller of which is the rear fork. The main load is carried by the larger triangle. The size of the frames of a classic triangular shape with a horizontal upper beam is measured in centimeters and is equal to the length of the vertical support pipe from the axis of the driving gear to its upper section. In Italy, the size is equal to the perpendicular "dropped" from the driving axis to the upper horizontal tube of the frame triangle.
      </p>
      <h3> 
        <em>Other components</em>
      </h3>
      <p> 
        Cheap bikes (as well as almost all children's bikes) are equipped with a single chain drive and an overrunning clutch. The overtaking clutch ensures the transmission of torque to the wheel only if the speed on the pedal sprocket exceeds the speed on the wheel sprocket
      </p>
      <p> 
        More expensive bikes have gear shifting. Since the legs develop maximum power with a certain effort, switching speeds allows you to use muscle power more efficiently.

        Interesting Facts
      </h4>
      <p>
        <strong> The first record was set on May 11, 1893 by the Frenchman A. Desgrange. </strong> He ran 35 kilometers 325 meters in one hour on the Buffalo track in Paris.</p>
     <h5>
       History
     </h5>
     <p>
      <strong>At the beginning of the First World War, the Leitner and Co. plant was evacuated to Kharkiv,</strong> where one of the country's most powerful bicycle factories was founded on its base - the Kharkiv Bicycle Plant named after G. I. Petrovskyi (HVZ)[16]. The first Soviet bicycle rolled off the assembly line in Kharkiv on March 13, 1924.
     </p>
     <p> 
      In the Central Design and Technology Bureau of the CCTB Bicycle Building in Kharkiv, promising models of almost all types of bicycles were developed: road, tandem, tourist, women's, cargo, folding, teenage, children's. At one time, the KhVZ produced a special bicycle stroller for the writer Mykola Ostrovsky, and a five-wheel cycle for Oleg Popov's circus stunts, and produced old models of bicycles for use in films. This factory produced bicycles with the following names: "Ukraine", "Sputnik", "Tourist", "Start".
